    "description": "SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (\u2018MFS\u2019), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee\u2019s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters.  By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL\u2019s Universal Competency Framework (\u201cUCF\u201d), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
